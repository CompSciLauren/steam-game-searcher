:video_game: Opens Chrome tabs for Steam games based on a list of game titles

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Replace the contents of the input.txt file to include your list of games to search for on Steam.
4. Run `node index.js`
5. Wait for Chrome tabs to finish loading, then begin viewing games!

## Tips

- Every game you add to the input.txt file will be another Chrome tab to open. Don't add too many of these or you may experience significant lag. Start with 10 - 20 games and see how your computer handles it before increasing the number.
- Once you move your mouse over the Steam game in the tab, leave it there. Now it's previewing that Steam game. If you aren't interested in it, press CTRL+W to close that Chrome tab. Now the next Chrome tab is being viewed, and the mouse is already hovering over the next game, so the next preview can begin.
